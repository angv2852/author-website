# author-website

This website was the first project I tackled completely by myself. The point - to be able to replicate a website. This project has sentimental meaning to me, as it is my Moms professional website. She is an amazing author with many books.

I replicated this pixel perfect website, but after I was done, I added some needed changes; making some elements more user friendly and adding links where it would be more logical to have them. And I added some shadow around the books elements to make them look more appealing to the eye. I also used Bootstrap to add the hamburger menu. 

This website is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and is fully responsive.
