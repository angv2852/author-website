        />My Background
      </h3>
      <p>
        I grew up in Sandy, Utah, where my parents had a mini-farm set on an
        acre and a half. My father raised a lot of things, but the two main ones
        were gladiolus and mink. Yep—flowers and fur coats. My mom was a lucky
        woman. My mother was a florist, and I like to think I got a dose of
        creativity from her.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was raised as a Christian and am a member of The Church of Jesus
        Christ of Latter-day Saints. I’m thankful to know my Heavenly Father
        lives and loves me. He has blessed my life so abundantly. I also have a
        testimony of Jesus Christ; my Savior and the Redeemer of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended the University of Utah for a year, then transferred to Dixie
        College, where I met my husband. He was President of the Spanish club,
        and my classmates were deluded enough about my linguistic abilities to
        elect me Vice-President. Marriage followed. Many years and children
        later, I attended Utah State University. More years passed, then I
        returned to the University of Utah, coming full circle, and finally
        graduating with a Bachelor’s degree in English.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>My Loves and Interests</h3>
      <p>
        I met and married the love of my life, Kelly R. Sullivan and we had
        seven of the most wonderful children ever. I am so proud of them—they
        are all so amazing and wonderful, as are their terrific spouses. And,
        although others may brag about their grandchildren, I know mine are
        actually the cutest, smartest, sweetest, and most talented kids EVER!
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve always loved animals, and while my kids were growing up, we always
        had dogs and cats, and a revolving cast of gerbils, mice, tropical fish,
        hamsters, rats, parakeets, and various parrots. However, I drew the line
        at snakes and spiders. Yuck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I only have three cats and three dogs and feel deprived. I
        have a pudgy Westie named Biscuit, Brandi, a bossy-pants Welsh Corgi,
        and Penny; an amazingly loyal and playful red Labradoodle. Then there
        are the cats, who must feel their only purpose in life is to provide
        exercise and serve as living chew-toys to Penny. (Don’t worry, they know
        how to bring out the claws if they get tired of fun and games with
        Penny). Zoey is a ninja Bengal who can open closed doors. (It took a
        while to figure out that one—Kelly and I kept blaming each other for not
        “shutting” the door), Cinder, a Snow Bengal, and Jasmine, a Ragdoll.
      </p>
      <p>
        When not throwing tennis balls, letting the dogs take me for walks, or
        vacuuming up hair, I like to read. As a child, I spent nearly every free
        moment reading, and I still love sitting down with a good book. A few of
        my favorite authors are; Maeve Binchy, Elizabeth Berg, Agatha Christie,
        Andriana Trigiani, and Anne Siddons. Although getting caught up in a
        good book is one of life’s greatest pleasures, even better is curling up
        with snacks and watching pro football. On Saturdays, I love to watch the
        University of Utah (Go Utes!) and BYU (Go Cougars!). For me, there are
        only two seasons; football season and waiting for football season.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also love to go camping, although I no longer enjoy roughing it. We
        ended up buying a Fifth Wheel because, you know; Must. Have. Popcorn.
        Which means; Must. Have. Electricity. So yeah, a popcorn popper is
        standard equipment in our RV. My husband and I have a few favorite
        places nearby where we’ll spend idyllic week-long trips. Other times,
        we’ll head out to explore new places, often going to a new location in
        the U.S. so I can research settings for a new book.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like to garden. I love flowers—thank goodness, since I owned my
        own floral shop for nine years. Thanks again to my mother. I go a little
        nuts planting flowers in the spring and adding more tulip, hyacinth, and
        daffodil bulbs each fall. For years now, I’ve enjoyed raising iris.
        They’re addictive and I can’t resist adding a few new colors each year.
        Right now, I have more than 90 varieties, and my husband is tearing out
        his hair at his diminishing “vegetable garden”.
      </p>
      <p>
        At night, I like to unwind by watching TV. In addition to a few select,
        current shows, I enjoy watching I Love Lucy, Modern Family, MASH, The
        Big Bang Theory, and Andy Griffith. I also enjoy animated movies like
        Despicable Me, Over the Hedge, How to Train Your Dragon, Ice Age, and
        Frozen, and all of their sequels, among others. I’m a kid at heart.
      </p>

      <h3>My Writing Career</h3>
      <p>
        I’ve always wanted to be a writer. Always. I started penning stories in
        elementary school and after receiving extraordinary parental acclaim for
        one of my masterpieces; “The Old Blue Car,” felt encouraged enough to
        continue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Marriage and children caused “writing interruptus,” and for many years,
        my writing career was put on the back burner. I know women can have it
        all, but that’s easier said than done. I decided there was a time and a
        season for everything and decided to be a full-time mom and focus on my
        little ones while they were still, you know—little.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing still burned in my heart and soul, and when my children got past
        the baby stage, I began trying to carve out some time to write. Since my
        free time was extremely limited, writing a book was out of the question,
        so I began writing short articles and stories for magazines and
        newspapers. A few years later, I started writing an inspirational,
        non-fiction book; LDS Heroes and Heroines. It only took me six years to
        finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        As my children got older, it was necessary for us to have a second
        income. Since I wanted to be home for the children, we remodeled our
        garage, got the necessary permits, and opened a floral shop. I enjoyed
        it, but had no time to write. After nine years, I had some medical
        issues. While waiting to hear if the results of a biopsy showed cancer
        or a benign tumor, I looked back over my life and asked myself; If I had
        the chance to live my life over, would I do anything differently?
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than wishing I had been a better person and mother; I could only
        think of one other thing—I would have spent more time writing. So, with
        my dear husband’s support, we sold the business and I started writing
        full-time. My next three books were inspirational non-fiction, and I had
        a wonderful time researching angelic experiences in early Church
        history, which resulted in; And There Were Angels Among Them, Visits
        from Beyond the Veil, and By the Ministering of Angels. I then wrote
        another inspirational non- fiction book; Brigham’s Boys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around this time, I took a sabbatical from writing and went back to
        college. It had always been a dream of mine to graduate. So, with my
        last child in elementary school, I returned to college as what my
        advisors labeled a “mature student,” which is a kindlier way of saying
        you’re older than the hills. I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in
        English from the University of Utah.
      </p>
      <p>
        While at the University of Utah, I began working on my first novel. I’d
        wanted to write one for many years, but wasn’t sure if I had the talent
        or the ability. I worked on it in all of my writing classes and after
        three years, completed a romantic mystery titled, Light on Fire Island.
        I was thrilled when became a best-seller at local bookstores that
        featured writers who wrote books geared for members of The Church of
        Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I wrote another inspirational, non-fiction book about near-death
        experiences; Gaze into Heaven; Near-death Experiences in Early Church
        History.
      </p>
      <p>
        My next novel, Motive for Murder, was such a fun book to write! As the
        name implies, it’s a mystery, and the protagonist is a quirky private
        detective with OCD. I suppose it’s the researcher in me that made me
        decide to have the settings for my novels as accurate as possible. So,
        my husband and I get to travel to fun places to take a lot of pictures,
        talk with the locals, and take copious notes. I try very hard to be
        accurate when mentioning street names, restaurants, and local
        attractions in my books, and am careful to use the names of local
        plants, birds, and trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a thrill to be asked to contribute a story along with other
        authors in the inspirational book, How Will Christmas Find Us? I then
        wrote another inspirational non-fiction book; Heroes of Faith. I
        returned to fiction once more, and wrote two more mysteries; A Death in
        the Family and Crooked House; sequels to Motive for Murder and featuring
        the same fun and quirky OCD detective. After that, I wrote an
        inspirational book about the next life, The Magnificent World of
        Spirits, which contains many experiences of people who visited the
        spirit world, then came back to earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to try something new and wrote my first romance, which was
        another bestseller in the local bookstores; For Sale by Owner. However,
        my first love is mysteries and I then wrote Searching for Irene, which
        again turned out to be a local best seller.
